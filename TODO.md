#Things to do
* Improve the README.md file
* Build up the check_rules.rb tool and add a tutorial for it

#Things that have been done
* Record the filename that the rules are loaded from so that when reloading a set of rules the old versions are purged first
* Add a command to purge an old set of rules. Such as 'unload rules/time.rb'
