#Things to do

* Improve the README.md file
* <del>Record the filename that the rules are loaded from so that when reloading a set of rules the old versions are purged first</del>
* <del>Add a command to purge an old set of rules. Such as 'unload rules/time.rb'</del>
* Build up the check_rules.rb tool and add a tutorial for it
